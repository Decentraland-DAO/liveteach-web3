Adding teachers to a classroom once the classroom has been created can be achieved by accessing the Classroom Admin Screen
(accessible if your wallet you are connecting with is setup as an administrator), Click the "ADD" button on the top right
of the Teachers table:

There are only two inputs for this process which are, set the Teacher wallet address in the wallet address input and then
set the classroom/classrooms associated with that teacher. The dropdown menu for the Class is a multi select allowing you 
to select multiple classes for a teacher.

Once you are happy with the settings click add on the top right-hand side and a metamask transaction will be initiated
confirm if you are happy to proceed.

When the transaction has been processed the Classroom Admin screen wil show the new teacher on the Teachers table.

Teachers can be removed by clicking the "REMOVE" button on the table in the row of the teacher you wish to remove, this
will also open a metamask transaction window for you to confirm.
