### Polls, Quiz and Reference Links

#### Polls

For polls content we have another set of inputs available to add our topic and choices:

In similar fashion use the inputs to create your polls adding and removing options to suit your needs, you can also add
polls here to have multiple polls in the lesson.


#### Quiz

The approach for the Quiz content again is very similar to the polls the only difference in these inputs is to add the 
correct answer.

#### Reference Links

The Reference Links section is where we can define some urls that the teacher can share with students, such as social
links etc. There are two fields here a Source (the main url) and a caption which can be displayed in the scene.
